#Function decision
#Description: this will be the crucial function in the decision-making, it will take as input the user's current score-card, current five-dice roll, and the number of rolls the user has done in their turn, and then output which dice to re-roll and which category to aim for

	#If number of rolls remaining is zero
		#decide where user should place their turn based on scoreboard
	#Otherwise
		#First go through all 6! (720) final dice combinations
			#Decide where user would place that that roll based on scoreboard
			#Find the point value associated with that roll
		#If user has one roll remaining
			#Loop through all possible subsets of dice from user's current roll(a max of 32)
				#Set a float accumulator
				#Loop through possible combinations of dice after reroll
					#Multiply value of total dice combination value by the probability of getting that dice combination, then add to accumulator
			#Choose subset that has the highest accumulator value
		#Otherwise the user has two rolls remaining
			#First loop through all 720 dice combinations
				#Loop through all possible subsets of dice (a max of 32)
					#Set a float accumulator
					#Loop through possible combinations of dice after reroll
						#Multiply value of total dice combination value by the probability of getting that dice combination, then add to accumulator
				#Choose subset that has the highest accumulator value, then push that value onto the that dice combination
			#Loop through all possible subsets of dice from user's current roll( a max of 32)
				#Set a float accumulator
				#Loop through possible combinations of dice after reroll
					#Multiply value of total dice combination found earlier by the probabilit of getting that dice combination, then add to accumulator
			#Choose subset that has the highest accumulator value
